# Description
# -----------
# This table stores the registrations of customer for an workshop.  The customer
# record must be created and then setup as an workshop registration.
#
# This table can be used to allow one customer to purchase multiple tickets.  If
# there is no additional information required for the registration, there can
# be one entry with num_tickets > 0.  If there is required information about each
# person attending the workshop, then there should be a customer account created for
# each registration, and multiple entries in the registration_answers table for
# each of the customer attending.  This setup allows for simple to complex registration
# scenarios.
#
# There is no status field, as customers are either registered or no.  There is a status
# on the invoice for if they've paid or not.
#
# Fields
